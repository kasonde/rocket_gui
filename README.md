# ðŸš€ Rocket GUI

Rocket CLI will by my syntactic sugar on top of the Strapi CLI, specifically with creating projects and organizing them. The rest will be mananged by the Strapi CLI itself.

# Specifications/Goals ðŸŽ¯

[ ] Trying to decide between NPM package or Bash script right now.

- Start a project with a default folder name (date-number_of_project)
- Specify name prefix with flag (--normal or --issue)
- Search for projects by specifying some date ranges i.e: rocket yesterday to navigate to yesterdays folder or rocket --list yesterday to list yesterdays folder
- Specify version number for strapi
- Specify array of strapi flags (some may be default)

# Future goals ðŸ”®

- Have a registry to store projects generated with rocket and store descriptions for easier search? That would be nice.
